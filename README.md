Ideas & features I want to add but are outside the scope of this project:
- Let the computer "cheat" by weighting the "random" choice towards paper, because the human player is more likely to choose rock (its the first in the list and easiest to type)
- Let the player cheat with secret input options - ie.: bomb beats everything
- Option to unlock "advanced mode", which turns the game into rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock
- Show the running score in the HTML page instead of console, and show stats about games won/lost
- Create logging so I can review how people played the game and what they chose
- Create a web page for showing lifetime / historical player stats - leaderboard? Fancy graphs?
- More robust error handling for typed human input (TOP project page explicitly says don't worry about this yet)
- Buttons to click on instead of relying on typed input - covered in later lesson
- Simplify and condense code - covered in later lesson
